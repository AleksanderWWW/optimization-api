## Overview

Choosing the right asset proportions to the investment portfolio is probably as much a science as an art.
This API takes care of the former. When provided with a list of assets from which to choose, the algorithm
will return a math-based suggestion on how to proportionate those assets in your investment.

Choose one of the three availible algorithms or use them all at the same time and compare results.
The API allows you to configure the metaparameters for the algorithms, but all of them are equiped 
with sensible defaults as well. 

Let's walk through the foundations on how to use *optimization-api* and how you can integrate it
in your financial workflow.

Enjoy!
